# Project Description

Welcome to Project Rewrite! This program is a collection of functions that perform various tasks, such as finding the minimum of two numbers, finding the maximum value in a list of numbers, and finding the length of a list.

This project reimplements some basic built-in functionalities of a language or its standard library for pedagogical reasons without using built-in functionalities or the standard library itself. Please note that this code should not be used in commercial projects.

## How to use

To use this program, run main.py in your terminal. A menu will be displayed, allowing you to select one of the following options:

- Minimum of two numbers
- Maximum of a list of numbers
- Length of a list
- Multiply two numbers
- Power of a number
- Division and Modulus of two numbers
- Exit

Follow the prompts to enter the necessary information, and the selected function will be executed.

## Functions

Here is a brief overview of the functions available in this program:

- min_func: Finds the minimum of two numbers.
- max_func: Finds the maximum value in a list of numbers.
- length: Finds the length of a list.
- multiply: Multiplies two numbers.
- power: Raises a number to a power.
- div_mod: Divides two numbers and returns the result and the modulus.
