# Project Description

This project reimplements some basic built-in functionalities of a language or its standard library for pedagogical reasons without using built-in functionalities or the standard library itself. Please note that this code should not be used in commercial projects.

## Criteria

### min()

Implement the min(x, y) function for two real numbers as inputs.

- For any two real numbers, the lesser is returned.
- No built-in functions are used.

### max()

Implement the max(values_list) function for a list of numbers.

- For any list of real numbers, the greatest is returned.
- No built-in functions are used.

### len()

Implement the len(values_list) function for a list of numbers or strings which returns the length of the list.

- For any list, the number of its elements is returned.
- No built-in functions are used.

### multiply()

Implement the multiply(x, y) function for integer numbers as inputs.

- Do not use the *, /, and // operators or any built-in functions. You can use +.
- For any two integer inputs, the returned value equals the result of x* y.
- Neither *, /, // nor any built-in functions are used.

### pow()
Implement the pow(x, y) function for real base numbers and positive integer exponents!

- Do not use the ** operator or any built-in functions. You can use *.
- For inputs from the specified domain, the returned value equals the result of x**y.
- Neither ** nor any built-in functions are used.

### divmod() (optional task)
Implement the divmod(x, y) function for two integer numbers as inputs.

- Do not use the // and the % operators or any built-in functions.
- The return value must be a tuple where the first value is equal to the value of x // y and the second value is equal to the value of x % y.
= For any two positive integer inputs, the returned value equals (x // y, x % y).
= For any two +/- integer inputs, the returned value equals (x // y, x % y).
- Neither // nor any built-in functions are used.
